# Zombie-head-maze-game-Python-turtle
A maze game using only python turtle. Pygame for music!!!<br>
This might only work in python 3.x
This is a game for fun you can also use it for example.

## TODO
1.You need to download Pygame by openning your cmd and type in: python3.6 -m pip install pygame or you can <a href="www.pygame.org">click here</a> to go to pygame.org<br>
2. make sure you put all the two files and python together.<br>
3.run the python file(maze.py).<br>
**Change to the dir before running maze.py**
